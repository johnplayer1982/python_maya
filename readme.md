# Python Maya

## Purpose

This repo stores all of my python scripts for use in Maya.  For help setting up your environment:

- [Setting up your build environment](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU/?guid=__files_Setting_up_your_build_environment_htm)

## Example scripts

Example scripts are prefixed with "ex_" and show small examples of methods and functions.

## Complete Scripts

*objectRenamer.py*

Renames objects based on type and returns a list of all of the renamed objects.
Camera's are bypassed.
